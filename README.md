### Mass spectrometry-based proteomics: challenges and opportunities

Mass spectrometry is the technique of choice to study proteins in a
high throughput fashion. And while the final outputs that you might be
presented looks like a typical omics table, with assayed proteins
along the row and samples along the columns, the characteristics of
mass spectrometry result in some interesting features. In my talk, I
will describe how mass spectrometry is used to identify and quantify
proteins and highlight some important features of the acquisition
process. I will then present some recent applications of mass
spectrometry-based proteomics and conclude with challenges and
opportunities.
